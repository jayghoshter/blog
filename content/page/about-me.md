Hi and welcome to this website. 

Ever since I found out about websites and blogs, I've always wanted to have one. And I tried: blogspot and wordpress addresses -- some private, some public. These sites eventually just fizzled out because there was no _drive_ behind them -- no readership, no direction. If I wanted to journal, it didn't have to be heavily edited and politically correct, I could just as well do it on text files. And I'm not going to be providing an online service for anybody on the back of a *.wordpress.com website. That didn't feel professional enough. Not to mention the ups and downs of actual life. 

This is a rebooted effort to actually put my thoughts online and make them available to the world. Not that my thoughts and opinions are invaluable to the general public. No, I'm pretty much a lame hack that way -- there's nothing new under the sun. The effort is to see if I can grow, and get something out of just putting my thoughts out there. And if it ends up helping someone relate a little bit, I'll take that as a win. 

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Simulation Sciences at the RWTH Aachen/Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich, Germany. While I'm not doing that, I while away time in other worlds: consuming stories that are available to be read, heard or seen. I also **LOVE** scripting things that make my life easier or make me feel like a hacker. There are times when I'm consumed by a need to write. I've written some very short poems and stories that I haven't shown to a lot of people.

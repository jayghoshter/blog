I have forever wanted to have my own website up on the internet. With today's accessibility, that's possible in seconds if you're willing to sell your soul (i.e., be part of a social network, or a blogging network). I tried that route in my adolescent years, and then again in my early twenties. But there's something romantic and nostalgic about doing it the old fashioned way: A bare-bones site with an emphasis on content. 

Apart from being preoccupied by the more basic pursuits in life, I think it was the thought of hosting my page on someone else's domain name that made me lose interest in my previous endeavors. And here I am again, this time able to generate and host a humble little website for myself where I can post my musings, rants, ramblings, and wonderments for the world to read. 

So welcome to this little corner of the internet, fellow human. I hope your time here is fruitful in some way!

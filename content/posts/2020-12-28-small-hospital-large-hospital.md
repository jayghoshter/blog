**Disclaimer**: This is a one-sided story on a blog. I've missed some details -- some intentionally, some otherwise.

My mother has had the misfortune of being admitted in two hospitals in three weeks. One a small hospital with the minimum required qualifications to be called as such and a handful of doctors & staff, the other a megahospital with fancy equipment, more bureaucracy, and an army of doctors & staff.

I shall refer to the hospitals as S (small) and L (large). Just because.

In S, we found ourselves in a private room. There was a non-functioning TV mounted on the wall, an attached bathroom, and a bed for an attendant to sleep on. We were on the third floor of the building, with the first two reserved for CoViD patients. The walkway (astonishingly, a wheelchair accessible ramp) was sealed off with cheap plastic covering over a makeshift gated door at the third floor level. The reception and billing staff did not bother with masks for the most part, even though the guard just a few feet from them could be seen admonishing and restricting entry to those who were trying to enter without masks on.

The nurses in S were quite friendly and helpful for the most part. They communicated well, even though they offloaded the responsibility of feeding the patient onto us. The housekeeping staff visited twice a day to maintain the rooms. All in all, there was no doubt we were getting what we were paying for (in more ways than one).

Now I have a personal issue with the doctor that attended to my mother. I won't be going into that here. I'd rather silently fume over their actions than tarnish their reputation. 

A few days after her discharge from S, we were sufficiently misfortunate to have to admit her to a larger establishment, L. There was no direct admission -- emergency, paperwork, CoViD tests, wait really too long for results (negative), perform scans, don't get the room arrangement we asked for, settling for the general ward. There was a lot that happened on day one. But the emergency doctors handled things the way you'd expect from doctors: ask for the patient's list of complaints and detailed medical history. Bureaucracy aside, I was hopeful that the people at L might help her recover better.

Our designated doctor at L arrived the next day and spoke to me about what she was doing, her reasoning behind all the tests she was ordering, and the plan of action. This communication was SORELY missing from the doctors at S, who also seemed to have handled things at only a symptom level. If she's low on blood, give her blood. If she's got a fever, paracetamol. You get the gist. My respect for doctors at L increased when our primary physician coordinated with specialists to ensure that there was a deeper understanding of the patient's condition. 

The nurses, honestly, seemed understaffed, overburdened, and generally just doing things because they had to. The call bell was mostly left ignored because there was no one at the station anyway. Most of the nurses were, it seemed, apprentices, as well. This, combined with the abysmal housekeeping, left a sour taste in my mouth. L was a large hospital that charged accordingly. If we're paying so much for this shit, we deserved better service, goddamnit.

For what it's worth, the doctors were indeed much better -- perhaps due to the slew of advanced means of testing at their disposal, and the general proximity to specialists in other fields. And in the end, what mattered was my mother's recovery.

She did recover.

But it goes to show. You (don't) usually get what you pay for. The smaller hospital gave us more freedom, better communication with the nurses, but really shitty doctor behaviour. The larger hospital had better and more coordinated doctors, better equipment, but shitty nurses and housekeeping. 

To clarify: money wasn't the issue. It was the lack of scaling in the quality of all the services provided by the larger establishment.

The one advice I can give after all this is to go with better doctors. I mean someone who is a detective, not a beat-cop. Someone who studies the patient's condition, rather than just glances at their vitals & symptoms. And someone who's communicating with you all the way. After all, isn't that what doctors are supposed to do?
